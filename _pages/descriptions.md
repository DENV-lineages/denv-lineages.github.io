These are the descriptions of the current state of officially designated lineages. 
Clicking on each link takes you to a nextstrain build of genomes in the current data pull colored by region of the world.

Please don't worry if you don't see your exact sequence in the build: it may not have been released on genbank until after the current build, or it may have been downsampled out because there are lots of sequences already from that location.

If your sequence is newer than the last data download you want to find out what lineage your sequence is, you want to use an assignment tool like [genome detective](https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/dengue/) or [GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home) (NB GLUE IS NOT YET READY this is a placeholder)
